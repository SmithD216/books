        <p id="common-surnames">It looks as though most of the surnames totalled to 10 although there were some 9s in there.
            <br>I double checked this with two implementations but it looks like that's the case.
            <br>That aside, here are the top 10 most common according to my search:

        <p id="age-wealth">
            The ages in our sample ranged from 20 to 60.
            <br>Based on this if we say that ages 20-40 are 'young' and 41-60 is 'older' then we can also say that young people
            tend to have more money than older people.
            <br>This is indicated by seven young ages being in the top 10 versus 3 older. You could also use the average balance
            for a more accurate asseration.
            <br>Here we have the age ranges which have the highest total balance:
