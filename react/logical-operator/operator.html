                    //Therefore, if the condition is true, the element right after && will appear in the output. If it is false, React will ignore and skip it.
                    

                    //So it checks unreadMessages which is the messages array
                    //If the length is greater than 0 it's true which going by the above logic means that the next expression is also true so we display it
